    "# Simple Semantic Kernel Agent Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn to build AI agents with Semantic Kernel in just a few steps. This tutorial covers the essentials: creating agents, adding tools, and managing conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three foundational components in Semantic Kernel agents: \n",
    "1. Agent Class: All agent types inherit from this class. Agent types include ChatCompletionAgent (uses standard chat completion APIs), OpenAIAssistantAgent (leverages OpenAI Assistant API with built in tools), AzureAIAgent (integrates with Azure AI services for enterprise scenarios), CopilotStudioAgent (connects to Microsoft Copilot Studio workflows). \n",
    "2. Agent Thread: This handles how conversation history and state are maintained. This is important since agents need context from previous messages to make informed decisions. There are two approaches:\n",
    "    1. Service managed state: An agent service like Azure AI stores conversation history server-side, and accessed via thread ID.\n",
    "    2. Application managed state: Your application maintains the full chat history and passes it to the agent on each call. \n",
    "3. Agent orchestration: The framework provides pre-built patterns for coordinating multiple agents to handle complex workflows that single agents cannot manage effectively. \n",
    "    1. Sequential: Agents execute one after the other in order. This is like document processing pipeline.\n",
    "    2. Concurrent: Multiple agents working at the same time. Like customer inquiry handling (billing agent and account agent working in parallel).\n",
    "    3. Handoff: Agents pass control to each other based on specialization. Like customer service triage to specialist agent.\n",
    "    4. Group chat: Agents collaborate in a shared conversation. Like project planning with domain experts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents leverage Semantic Kernel’s plugin system to access tools, databases, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can also be defined using YAML.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
